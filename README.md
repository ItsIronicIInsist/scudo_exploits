Demo code illustrating some new techniques for exploiting the scudo allocator.

The libscudo that I target is the one in this repo - it is slightly old and doesnt have secondary quarantine.

It may be slightly modified, as I have previously edited it with printf debugging statements, but nothing that should affect allocator behaviour should still be in there.

Contact me on twitter / discord if you have any questions!
