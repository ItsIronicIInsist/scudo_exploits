Demo code illustrating some new techniques for exploiting the scudo allocator.

The libscudo that I target is the one in this repo - it is slightly old and doesnt have secondary quarantine.

It may be slightly modified, as I have previously edited it with printf debugging statements, but nothing that should affect allocator behaviour should still be in there.

NOTE: To properly set the settings for scudo, I also run
` export SCUDO_OPTIONS="thread_local_quarantine_size_kb=64:quarantine_size_kb=256:quarantine_max_chunk_size=2048"`
Which sets the quarantine settings used for the demos

Contact me on twitter / discord if you have any questions!
